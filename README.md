Useful notes, data, notebooks for before and after the Strata 2018 tutorial "Learning Machine Learning with Astronomy Datasets".

Strata_For_Participants.ipynb is the "white canvas" notebook we started with, and "Strata_FinalNotebook.ipynb" is the filled-in notebook including everything that we discussed (and a few things we didn't get to, such as GBMs).
